Description: MOJN I&M STLK 2021
 
Abstract: This report summarizes data quality evaluations of discrete data collected for the Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Program (MOJN I&M) Streams and Lakes protocol from 2021. This protocol is designed to monitor the hydrologic and ecosystem health of nine streams and six subalpine lakes in Great Basin National Park (GRBA) and to identify and assess the effects of stressors such as climate change, groundwater withdrawal, and atmospheric nutrient deposition. Data collected include lake level surveys, water quality measurements, water chemistry samples, and benthic macroinvertebrate samples.
