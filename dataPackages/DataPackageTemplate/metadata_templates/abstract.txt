In 2013, Executive Order 13642, Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information (GPO 2013),  and associated policies issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB 2013) mandated that all data be made public  by default unless those data are protected from release by one or more authorities. Staff at all National Park Service (NPS)  units where the Inventory & Monitoring Division conducts activities identified resources that warrant some level of  data protection, and default rules to be used when disseminating information about those resources. In nearly all cases,  information about taxa on the federal list of taxa with conservation status (USFWS 2019) were identified as taxa about  which data must be protected from public relese. This report documents the creation of a standard dataset of federally-protected taxa for each NPS unit to use in developing public-access versions of inventory & monitoring data sets developed by the NPS Inventory  and Monitoring Program.
