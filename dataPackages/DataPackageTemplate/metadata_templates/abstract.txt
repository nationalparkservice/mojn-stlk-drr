This report summarizes data quality evaluations of discrete data collected for the Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Program (MOJN I&M) Streams and Lakes (STLK) monitoring protocol from 2009 to 2020. This protocol is designed to monitor the ecosystem health of nine streams and six subalpine lakes in Great Basin National Park (GRBA) and to identify and assess the effects of stressors such as climate change, groundwater withdrawal, and atmospheric nutrient deposition. Data collected include lake level surveys, water quality measurements, water chemistry samples, and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages.
