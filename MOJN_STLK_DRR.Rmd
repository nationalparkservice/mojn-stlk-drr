# Background & Introduction
The following information is summarized from the *Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring streams and lakes monitoring protocol: Protocol narrative version 1.0* (NPS/MOJN/NRR—2012/593), available here: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2190889. Refer to the protocol narrative for more detailed information.

## Significance
Streams and lakes in Great Basin National Park (GRBA) provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms, contribute to local water supplies, and serve as popular visitor destinations. Aquatic and riparian habitats are important compared to their relatively small land cover because they often host endemic biota and support higher levels of biodiversity. Up to 80% of all vertebrates in the western United States depend on riparian habitats for at least part of their life cycles, and more than half are completely dependent on riparian habitats. Recently, the regionally-endemic Bonneville cutthroat trout has been reintroduced to streams and lakes in the park.

## Threats and Stressors
Climate change poses a threat to surface water resources in GRBA. Climate change affects precipitation and snowmelt patterns, which control stream flow regime--the amount and variability in discharge--as well as lake hydrology and physical limnology. Flow regime is the key driver of ecosystem processes in streams. In addition, climate change affects water temperatures and thermal regimes, which are also important determinants of biotic communities and ecosystem processes in streams and lakes.

Other potential threats include groundwater pumping in valleys adjacent to GRBA, cultural eutrophication, sedimentation, acid rain, input of contaminants, fishing, and the introduction of non-native species. Cultural eutrophication through the atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus may lead to changes in food webs and fisheries and can exacerbate hypoxia events in lakes. Acid rain may decrease pH and alter the nutrient status of lakes. Lakes such as those at GRBA with low natural buffering capacity are particularly vulnerable to the effects of acidification. The combined effects of invasive grasses, past fire suppression, and climate change may result in large and catastrophic fires within the park. Large fires, particularly those burning entire watersheds, could be major disturbances for aquatic biota in streams and lakes.

## Sample Design
The Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Program (MOJN I&M) monitors nine perennial streams and six subalpine lakes in GRBA as part of the Streams and Lakes protocol (Figure 1).

All nine streams are visited annually in August to collect water quality channel cross sections, water chemistry samples, and benthic macroinvertebrate samples. In addition, five permanent gaging stations on four of the streams are visited biweekly throughout the summer to calibrate sondes that record continuous water quality during the period of high flow. Four of these permanent gaging stations also have pressure transducers that record continuous stage, which is later converted to discharge through a rating curve. Discharge at the fifth permanent gaging station is monitored by the US Geological Survey (USGS).

The lakes are visited annually in September to collect water quality depth profiles, water chemistry samples, water clarity through Secchi depth measurements, and water surface elevations through digital level surveys. These water surface elevations are tied to continuous lake level recorded by pressure transducers.

Lehman, NPS)", fig.alt = "Map of Great Basin National Park with lines for streams, dots for lakes, and symbols indicating different types of monitoring locations. Great Basin National Park is located in central-eastern Nevada along the border with Utah. The nine monitored streams are Shingle, Pine, and Ridge on the western slope of the Southern Snake Range, and Strawberry, Mill, Lehman, Baker, Snake, and South Fork Big Wash on the eastern slope. The six monitored lakes are Stella, Teresa and Brown clustered together in the north of the park below Wheeler Peak; Baker below Baker Peak; and Johnson and Dead in the middle of the park slightly below Pyramid Peak."}

```

## Monitoring Questions
The goal of this protocol is to gather information that will aid in the assessment, conservation, and restoration of surface water resources in GRBA. To achieve this goal, MOJN I&M collects data to address the following monitoring questions:

**Streams:**

1. Are the amount or seasonal patterns of discharge changing over time?

1. What is the status of and what are the trends in water chemistry?

1. What is the status of and what are the trends in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages? 

**Lakes:**

1. Are water levels or the lake ice-free season changing over time?

1. What is the status of and what are the trends in water chemistry?

# Methods

## Data Collection and Sample Processing
Field methods used are described in *Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Streams and Lakes Protocol: Standard Operating Procedures and Supplementary Materials Version 1.0* (NPS/MOJN/NRR—2012/593.1), available here: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2190896. Specific methods include SOP 6: Handheld Water Quality Instruments, SOP 7: Sample Handling, Storage, and Shipping, SOP 9: Stream Discharge, SOP 10: Lakes Field Procedures, SOP 11: Continuous Water Quality Sonde, and SOP 12: Stream Chemistry and BMI Sampling.

Water chemistry samples were analyzed by the Oregon State University Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory (CCAL). Their laboratory methods can be found here: http://ccal.oregonstate.edu/sops, and their QA/QC measures can be found here: http://ccal.oregonstate.edu/qaqc.

Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were analyzed by the Utah State University BugLab. Their laboratory methods can be found here: https://www.usu.edu/buglab/SampleProcessing/LaboratoryProcedures/, and their QA/QC measures can be found here: https://www.usu.edu/buglab/SampleProcessing/QualityStandards/. These samples are stored by the BugLab at their facility in Logan, UT.

Summaries of these laboratory methods are also described in *Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Streams and Lakes Protocol: Standard Operating Procedures and Supplementary Materials Version 1.0* (NPS/MOJN/NRR—2012/593.1), available here: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2190896. Specific methods include SOP 13: Laboratory Analysis of BMI and SOP 14: Laboratory Analysis of Water Chemistry.

## Data Processing
Data were evaluated using a collection of QC checks that are part of the MOJN I&M Streams and Lakes R package. These evaluations are summarized in Section 4 of this document. Where unresolvable data quality issues existed, they have been described by a flag note in the data record, and a flag has been assigned to indicate the level of concern. These flags include Information (not expected to impact the validity of this data), Warning (care should be taken when including this record in analyses), and Critical (serious concerns about the quality of this record and it should not be used in analyses).

## Code Availability
All of the code used in the preparation of this data package is available in the MOJN I&M Streams and Lakes R Package <INSERT LINK>.

# Data Records
Ten CSV data files are provided that contain raw values suitable for use with the MOJN I&M Streams and Lakes R package. Three additional CSV data files are provided that contain calculated values generated using this R package. These files are clearly labeled as "calculated" (Table 1).

One data dictionary for all of the tables and fields in the published CSV files is provided in CSV format with this data package. 

The published product is one data package containing multiple CSV data files:

# Data Quality Evaluation

The data within the data records listed above have been reviewed by staff in the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Division to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency with documented data quality standards, as well as for usability and reproducibility. For additional information on data quality standards for this protocol, refer to *Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Streams and Lakes Protocol: Standard Operating Procedures and Supplementary Materials Version 1.0* (NPS/MOJN/NRR—2012/593.1), available here: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2190896. Specific methods include SOP 15: Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and SOP 16: Cumulative Measurement Bias.

## Advice and Caveats
- In 2009, Brown Lake and Dead Lake were not monitored as part of the pilot field season. 
- In 2009, no comparable lake level data were collected due to different reference marks used during the pilot field season. 
- In 2009, no channel characteristics or water quality cross-section data were collected at the streams as part of the pilot field season.
- In 2009, CCAL measured alkalinity as HCO3. From 2010 onward, CCAL measured alkalinity as CaCO3. The alkalinity values from 2009 were recalculated to match the more recent method.
- In 2009 and 2010, Baker Creek was monitored on the south fork (BAKR2). From 2011 onward, Baker Creek was monitored on the main stem (BAKR3).
- In 2013, Johnson Lake and Dead Lake were not monitored due to the lapse in federal appropriations.
- Due to an error in laboratory software programming, alkalinity values reported in 2014 and earlier that are less than 20 mg/L may be overestimated, with the discrepancy increasing closer to 0 mg/L.
- In 2015, no data were collected at Dead Lake because the lake was entirely dry.
- In 2016, no water chemistry data are available for Baker Creek because the wrong location was sampled accidentally.
- In 2017, no water quality data were collected at Baker Lake due to leaking waders. 
- In 2018, the method for determining benchmark and lake level elevations transitioned from string surveys to digital level surveys.

`r if(params$isAccessible == "yes") {"## Sites not visited"} else {"## Sites not visited {.tabset}"}`

This is a list of sites that were not visited for annual monitoring during a field season. Stream sampling moved from Baker Creek South Fork (GRBA_S_BAKR2) to Baker Creek Main Stem (GRBA_S_BAKR3) in 2011. Brown Lake and Dead Lake were not monitored during the pilot field season in 2009. Dead Lake and Johnson Lake were not monitored in 2013 due to the lapse in federal appropriations. While Dead Lake was monitored in 2015, no data were collected because the lake was entirely dry.
``` {r no.visits, fig.alt = "Table listing all of the streams or lakes that were not visited during any given field season."}
no.visits <- qcNoAnnualVisit(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

              columns = list(SiteName = colDef(aggregate = "unique"),
                             SampleFrame = colDef(aggregate = "unique"),
                             FieldSeason = colDef(aggregate = "unique")))
}
```

`r if(params$isAccessible == "yes") {"## Data processing levels"} else {"## Data processing levels {.tabset}"}`

This is a list of site visits that have any data labeled as "Raw" or "Provisional." These data need to be reviewed and moved to "Accepted" status before publication of the dataset.
``` {r dpl.check, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.alt = "Table listing any records with data still labeled as Raw or Provisional."}
dpl.check <- qcDPLCheck(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width=F, position = "left")
} else {
  dpl.check %>%
    dplyr::select(SiteCode, SiteName, VisitDate, FieldSeason, SampleFrame, VisitType) %>%
    reactable(details = function(index) {
      dpl <- dpl.check[index,] %>% 
        dplyr::select(ends_with(".DPL")) %>%
        rename_with(~ gsub(".DPL", "", .x)) %>%

      reactable(dpl, outlined = TRUE)
    },
    compact = TRUE, striped = TRUE)
}

```
`r if(nrow(dpl.check) == 0){"All records have been accepted."}`
`r if(nrow(dpl.check) > 0){"The above records need to be reviewed and accepted before publication."}`

`r if(params$isAccessible == "yes") {"## Lake surface and benchmark elevations"} else {"## Lake surface and benchmark elevations {.tabset}"}`

### Benchmark elevations
These are the mean values and standard deviations of final corrected elevations for each benchmark across all field seasons. Digital level readings began in 2018.
``` {r benchmark.elevations, fig.alt = "Table with calculated elevations for each lake benchmark and water surface since 2018 when the use of digital level surveys began."}
benchmark.elevations <- SurveyPointElevation(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

benchmark.elevations$ClosureError_ft <- round(benchmark.elevations$ClosureError_ft, 4)
benchmark.elevations$FinalCorrectedElevation_ft <- round(benchmark.elevations$FinalCorrectedElevation_ft, 4)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  benchmark.elevations %>%
    dplyr::select(-c(Park, SiteShort, DPL, VisitType)) %>%  
    knitr::kable() %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width=F, position = "left")  
} else {
  benchmark.elevations %>%
    dplyr::select(-c(Park, SiteShort, DPL, VisitType)) %>%
    reactable(searchable = TRUE, compact = TRUE, striped = TRUE)
}

```

### String survey heights
These are the mean values and standard deviations of string survey heights for each benchmark for each field season. The height of the benchmark above the water surface was typically measured seven times during the string survey. String surveys ended in 2018 and were replaced by digit level readings during that same field season, which have higher accuracy and precision. No comparable lake level data were collected in 2009 due to different reference marks used during the pilot field season.
``` {r string.heights, fig.alt = "Table with mean string heights and standard deviations for each lake benchmark from 2010 until the string method was last used in 2018."}
string.heights <- qcStringSurveyHeights(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

string.heights$MeanHeight_ft <- round(string.heights$MeanHeight_ft, 4)
string.heights$StDevHeight_ft <- round(string.heights$StDevHeight_ft, 4)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  string.heights %>%
    dplyr::select(-c(Park, SiteShort, VisitType)) %>%
    dplyr::ungroup() %>%
    knitr::kable() %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width=F, position = "left")  
} else {
  string.heights %>%
    dplyr::select(-c(Park, SiteShort, VisitType)) %>%
    dplyr::ungroup() %>%
    reactable(searchable = TRUE, compact = TRUE, striped = TRUE)
}
```

### String survey elevations
These are the mean values and standard deviations of string survey lake level elevations for each field season. The reference mark designated Benchmark 1 was typically used to calculate the final lake level at each lake. String surveys ended in 2018 and were replaced by digit level readings during that same field season, which have higher accuracy and precision.
``` {r string.elevations, fig.alt = "Table with calculated elevations for each lake water surface from 2010 until the string method was last used in 2018."}
string.elevations <- qcStringSurveyElevations(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

string.elevations$MeanFinalElevation_ft <- round(string.elevations$MeanFinalElevation_ft, 4)
string.elevations$StDevFinalElevation_ft <- round(string.elevations$StDevFinalElevation_ft, 4)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  string.elevations %>%
    dplyr::select(-c(Park, SiteShort, VisitType)) %>%
    knitr::kable() %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width=F, position = "left")
} else {
  string.elevations %>%
    dplyr::select(-c(Park, SiteShort, VisitType)) %>%
    reactable(searchable = TRUE, compact = TRUE, striped = TRUE)
}
```

### Benchmark elevation plots
This is a plot of the final corrected elevations for each benchmark for each field season. Consistent upward or downward trends in the elevation of a benchmark may indicate that the benchmark is unstable. An abrupt change in the elevation of a benchmark may indicate disturbance at the location of the benchmark. Only digital level readings are included, which began in 2018.
``` {r benchmark.plots, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Line graphs of benchmark elevations at each lake since 2018, with field season on the x-axis and elevation in feet on the y-axis."}
benchmark.plots <- PlotBenchmarkElevation(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  benchmark.plots
} else {
  ggplotly(benchmark.plots)
}
```

### Lake surface elevations
These are the final calculated water surface elevations for each lake across all field seasons. Digital level readings began in 2018.
``` {r lake.elevations, fig.alt = "Table with all calcuated lake water surface elevations, including string and digital level methods."}
lake.elevations <- LakeSurfaceElevation(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  lake.elevations %>%
    dplyr::select(-c(Park, SiteShort, VisitType, DPL)) %>%
    knitr::kable() %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width=F, position = "left")

### Dissolved nitrogen
These are the records where the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) exceeds total nitrogen (UTN). If the discrepancy falls within precision limits, this indicates that nearly all of the nitrogen is dissolved, and the two concentrations are essentially equal to each other. If the discrepancy falls outside of precision limits, this may indicate contamination of the sample. Alternatively, this may be a consequence of the natural heterogeneity of the water body. The total nutrient concentration is measured from the unfiltered sample, while the dissolved nutrient concentration is measured from the filtered sample. These two samples are collected at approximately the same time and location, but there may be some variability that becomes more evident at low concentrations.

```
There are `r nrow(chem.TDN %>% filter(TDNvUTN >= 0.02))` records where the concentration of dissolved nitrogen is greater than the total nitrogen concentration and the difference is outside the normal limits of variability.

### Nitrate and nitrite
These are the records where the concentration of nitrate (NO3) and nitrite (NO2) exceeds either total nitrogen (UTN) or total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). If the discrepancy falls within precision limits, this indicates that nearly all of the nitrogen or dissolved nitrogen is in the form of nitrate and nitrite, and the two concentrations are essentially equal to each other. If the discrepancy falls outside of precision limits, this may indicate contamination of the sample. Alternatively, this may be a consequence of the natural heterogeneity of the water body. The total nutrient concentration is measured from the unfiltered sample, while the dissolved nutrient concentration (including nitrate and nitrite) is measured from the filtered sample. These two samples are collected at approximately the same time and location, but there may be some variability that becomes more evident at low concentrations.

There are `r nrow(chem.NO3NO2)` records where the concentration of nitrate and nitrate is greater than the concentration of either total nitrogen or total dissolved nitrogen.

### Dissolved phosphorus
These are the records where the concentration of total dissolved phosphorus exceeds total phosphorus. If the discrepancy falls within precision limits, this indicates that nearly all of the phosphorus is dissolved, and the two concentrations are essentially equal to each other. If the discrepancy falls outside of precision limits, this may indicate contamination of the sample. Alternatively, this may be a consequence of the natural heterogeneity of the water body. The total nutrient concentration is measured from the unfiltered sample, while the dissolved nutrient concentration is measured from the filtered sample. These two samples are collected at approximately the same time and location, but there may be some variability that becomes more evident at low concentrations.

There are `r nrow(chem.TDP %>% filter(TDPvUTP >= 0.003))` records where the concentration of dissolved phosphorus is greater than the total phosphorus concentration and the difference is outside the normal limits of variability.

### MDL
Minimum detection level (MDL) is defined by the EPA as the "minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the analyte concentration is greater than zero." Below this concentration, presence of the analyte cannot be confirmed. These are the records where the concentration of a certain analyte was less than or equal to the MDL for that analyte.

              striped = TRUE)
}
```
There are `r nrow(chem.MDL)` analytes with concentrations less than or equal to the MDL.

### ML
Minimum level of quantitation (ML) is defined as the "concentration at which the analytical system gives a recognizable signal and acceptable calibration point for the analyte." Below this concentration, the analyte may be detected (if greater than the MDL) but not measured at a known level of confidence. These are the records where the concentration of a certain analyte was less than or equal to the ML for that analyte.

There are `r nrow(chem.ML)` analytes with concentrations less than or equal to the ML.

### Stream nutrients plot
This is a plot of nutrient concentrations for each stream for each field season. Nutrient concentrations include total nitrogen (UTN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate and nitrite as nitrogen (NO3NO2-N), total phosphorus (UTP), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is analyzed occasionally as funding allows.
``` {r chem.stream.nutrient.plot, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream nutrient concentrations, with field season on the x-axis and concentration in milligrams per liter on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and each of the six nutrient analytes has a horizontal panel."}

### Stream nutrients bar plot
This is a bar plot of nutrient concentrations for each stream for each field season. Nutrient concentrations include total nitrogen (UTN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate and nitrite as nitrogen (NO3NO2-N), total phosphorus (UTP), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). Total and dissolved concentrations are plotted on the same graph to show the relative contributions from each form.
``` {r chem.stream.nutrient.bar.plot, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Bar graphs of stream nutrient concentrations, with field season on the x-axis and concentration in milligrams per liter on the y-axis.

### Stream ions plot
This is a plot of ion concentrations for each stream for each field season. Ion concentrations include sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfate as sulfur (SO4-S), and chloride (Cl). Alkalinity (ALK2) is also analyzed.

Alkalinity is a property of water defined by the USGS as "the buffering capacity of a water body; a measure of the ability of the water body to neutralize acids and bases and thus maintain a fairly stable pH level." As alkalinity decreases, the sensitivity of a water body to acidification increases. Alkalinity is expressed as mg-CaCO3/L. In 2009, the laboratory measured alkalinity as HCO3. From 2010 to the present, the laboratory measured alkalinity as CaCO3. The alkalinity values from 2009 were recalculated to match the method from 2010 onward. Due to an error in laboratory software programming, ALK2 values analyzed in 2014 and earlier that are less than 20 mg/L may be overestimated (typically 1.5 to 2.5 mg/L, up to 35% difference), with the discrepancy increasing closer to 0 mg/L.
``` {r chem.stream.ion.plot, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream ion concentrations, with field season on the x-axis and concentration in milligrams per liter on the y-axis.

### Discrepancies
These are stream BMI records with discrepancies between taxa group count (or richness; number of taxa within a group) and taxa group abundance (number of individuals per m2 within a group). Discrepancies include situations where the taxa count is non-zero but abundance is zero and where abundance is non-zero and taxa count is zero. These situations may arise from the standardization of richness-based (taxa group count) metrics to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), while density-based (taxa group abundance) metrics are based on the raw taxa list.
``` {r bmi.discrepancies, fig.alt = "Table of records where where is a discrepancy between taxa group count and taxa group abundance."}

              striped = TRUE)
}
```
There are `r nrow(bmi.discrepancies)` metrics with discrepancies between taxa group count and taxa group abundance.

### General metrics plot
This plot shows total richness (number of unique taxa within a sample) and total abundance (number of individuals per m2 within a sample) for stream BMI samples. Richness metrics are standardized to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), while abundance metrics are based on the raw taxa list.
``` {r bmi.gen.plot, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate general metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and richness and abundance each have a horizontal panel. Counts for the total sample and for dominant family are represented by different line colors."}

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.gen.plot
} else {

```

### Diversity metrics plot
This plot shows various diversity metrics and indices for stream BMI samples. Shannon's Diversity is the measure of richness and evenness (based on relative abundance of each species) weighted toward rare species. Simpson's Diversity is the measure of richness and evenness (based on relative abundance of each species) weighted toward common species. Evenness is the measure of relative abundance indicative of taxa dominance. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) is the abundance-weighted average of family-level pollution tolerances.
``` {r bmi.div.plot, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate diversity metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and each of the four diversity metrics has a horizontal panel."}

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.div.plot
} else {
  ggplotly(bmi.div.plot)
}
```

### Tolerance metrics plot
This plot shows richness (number of taxa within a group) and abundance (number of individuals within a group) for stream BMI samples. Richness metrics are standardized to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), while abundance metrics are based on the raw taxa list.

Groups are based on tolerance to disturbance or pollution. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) is the abundance-weighted average of family-level pollution tolerances, and is plotted in the diversity metrics section. Tolerant taxa have an HBI score >=8 and are able to withstand disturbance and poor water quality. Intolerant taxa have an BMI score <=2 and are not as able to withstand disturbance and poor water quality. EPT refers to the insect orders Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Tricoptera (caddisflies), which are sensitive to disturbance and whose presence and abundance can indicate good water quality. Long-lived taxa have 2- to 3-year life cycles can indicate habitat stability and persistent good water quality in their habitat. Clinger taxa have fixed retreats or other strategies for clinging to rocks and are vulnerable to the deposition of fine sediments.
``` {r bmi.tol.plot, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate tolerance metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and richness and abundance each have a horizontal panel. Counts for the five tolerance groups are represented by different line colors."}
bmi.tol.plot <- BMIToleranceMetricsPlot(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.tol.plot
} else {
  ggplotly(bmi.tol.plot)
}
```

### Functional feeding group metrics plot
This plot shows richness (number of taxa within a group) and abundance (number of individuals within a group) for stream BMI samples. Richness metrics are standardized to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), while abundance metrics are based on the raw taxa list.

Groups are based on functional feeding groups, which refer to the type of food resource that species utilize in the stream. Shredder taxa consume living or decomposing vascular plant tissue and coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM). Scraper taxa consume periphyton, particularly algae and diatoms. Collector-filterer taxa consume fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) in the water column. Collector-gatherer taxa consume FPOM from benthic deposits. Predator taxa consume living animal tissue, usually other BMI, but occasionally small vertebrates. They can indicate that a habitat supports higher trophic complexity.
``` {r bmi.fun.plot, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate functional feeding group metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and richness and abundance each have a horizontal panel. Counts for the five functional feeding groups are represented by different line colors."}
bmi.fun.plot <- BMIFunctionalMetricsPlot(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.fun.plot
} else {
  ggplotly(bmi.fun.plot)
}
```

### Taxonomic metrics plot
This plot shows richness (number of taxa within a group) and abundance (number of individuals within a group) for stream BMI samples. Richness metrics are standardized to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), which abundance metrics are based on the raw taxa list.

Groups are based on taxonomic levels. Insecta is a class of six-legged invertebrates within the arthropod phylum. Coleoptera is an order of insects that includes beetles. Diptera is an order of insects that includes flies and midges. Megaloptera is an order of insects that includes dobsonflies. Plecoptera is an order of insects that includes stoneflies. Chironomidae is a family within Diptera that includes non-biting midges. Elmidae is a family within Coleoptera that includes riffle beetles. Non-insects include all individuals not within the class Insecta. Mollusca is a phylum that includes gastropods (e.g., snails and slugs), cephalopods (e.g., octopus and squids), and bivalves (e.g., clams). Crustacea is another class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that includes crabs, lobsters, crayfish, barnacles, and copepods. Oligochaeta is is a subclass of segmented worms within the annelid phylum that includes earthworms.

This is visualization of data that can be found in the BMI.csv file published with the data package.

``` {r bmi.tax.plot, warning = FALSE, fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate taxonomic metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and richness and abundance each have a horizontal panel. Counts for the twelve taxonomic groups are represented by different line colors."}
bmi.tax.plot <- BMITaxonomicMetricsPlot(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.tax.plot
} else {
