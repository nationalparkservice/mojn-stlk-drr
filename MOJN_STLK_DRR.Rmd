# Background & Introduction
The following background information is summarized from the *Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring streams and lakes monitoring protocol: Protocol narrative version 1.0* (NPS/MOJN/NRR—2012/593), available here: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2190889. Refer to the protocol narrative for more detailed information.

## Significance
Streams and lakes in Great Basin National Park (GRBA) provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms, contribute to local water supplies, and serve as popular visitor destinations. Aquatic and riparian habitats are important despite their relatively small land cover because they often host endemic biota and support higher levels of biodiversity than surrounding terrestrial habitats. Up to 80% of all vertebrates in the western United States depend on riparian habitats for at least part of their life cycles, and more than half are completely dependent on riparian habitats. Recently, the regionally-endemic Bonneville cutthroat trout has been reintroduced to streams and lakes in the park.

## Threats and Stressors
Climate change poses a threat to surface water resources in GRBA. Climate change affects precipitation and snowmelt patterns, which control stream flow regime (i.e., the amount and variability of discharge) as well as lake hydrology and physical limnology. Flow regime is the key driver of ecosystem processes in streams. In addition, climate change affects water temperatures and thermal regimes, which are also important determinants of biotic communities and ecosystem processes in streams and lakes.

Other potential threats include groundwater pumping in valleys adjacent to GRBA, cultural eutrophication, sedimentation, acid rain, input of contaminants, and the introduction of non-native species. Cultural eutrophication through the atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus may lead to changes in food webs and fisheries and can exacerbate hypoxia events in lakes. Acid rain may decrease pH and alter the nutrient status of lakes. Lakes such as those at GRBA with low natural buffering capacity are particularly vulnerable to the effects of acidification. The combined effects of invasive grasses, past fire suppression, and climate change may result in large and catastrophic fires within the park. Large fires, particularly those burning entire watersheds, could be major disturbances for aquatic biota in streams and lakes.

## Sample Design
The Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Program (MOJN I&M) monitors nine perennial streams and six subalpine lakes in GRBA as part of the Streams and Lakes protocol (Figure 1).

All nine streams are visited annually in August to collect water quality channel cross sections, water chemistry samples, and benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) samples. In addition, five permanent gaging stations on four of the streams are visited biweekly throughout the summer to calibrate sondes that record continuous water quality during the period of high flow. Four of these permanent gaging stations also have pressure transducers that record continuous stage, which is later converted to discharge through a rating curve. Discharge at the fifth permanent gaging station is monitored by the US Geological Survey (USGS).

The lakes are visited annually in September to collect water quality depth profiles, water chemistry samples, water clarity through Secchi depth measurements, and water surface elevations through digital level surveys. These water surface elevations are tied to continuous lake level recorded by pressure transducers.

Lehman, NPS)"), fig.alt = "Map of Great Basin National Park with lines for streams, dots for lakes, and symbols indicating different types of monitoring locations. Great Basin National Park is located in central-eastern Nevada along the border with Utah. The nine monitored streams are Shingle, Pine, and Ridge on the western slope of the Southern Snake Range, and Strawberry, Mill, Lehman, Baker, Snake, and South Fork Big Wash on the eastern slope. The six monitored lakes are Stella, Teresa and Brown clustered together in the north of the park below Wheeler Peak; Baker below Baker Peak; and Johnson and Dead in the middle of the park slightly below Pyramid Peak."}

```

## Monitoring Questions
The goal of this protocol is to gather information that will aid in the assessment, conservation, and restoration of surface water resources in GRBA. To achieve this goal, MOJN I&M collects data to address the following monitoring questions:

**Streams:**

1. Are the amount or seasonal patterns of discharge changing over time?

1. What is the status of and what are the trends in water chemistry?

1. What is the status of and what are the trends in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages? 

**Lakes:**

1. Are water levels or the lake ice-free season changing over time?

1. What is the status of and what are the trends in water chemistry?

# Methods

## Data Collection and Sample Processing
Field methods used are described in *Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Streams and Lakes Protocol: Standard Operating Procedures and Supplementary Materials Version 1.0* (NPS/MOJN/NRR—2012/593.1), available here: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2190896. Specific methods include SOP 6: Handheld Water Quality Instruments, SOP 7: Sample Handling, Storage, and Shipping, SOP 9: Stream Discharge, SOP 10: Lakes Field Procedures, SOP 11: Continuous Water Quality Sonde, and SOP 12: Stream Chemistry and BMI Sampling.

Water chemistry samples were analyzed by the Oregon State University Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory (OSU CCAL). Their laboratory methods can be found here: http://ccal.oregonstate.edu/sops, and their QA/QC measures can be found here: http://ccal.oregonstate.edu/qaqc.

Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were analyzed by the Utah State University National Aquatic Monitoring Center (USU NAMC). Their laboratory methods can be found here: https://namc-usu.org/SampleProcessing/LaboratoryProcedures, and their QA/QC measures can be found here: https://namc-usu.org/SampleProcessing/QualityStandards. These samples are stored by the BugLab at their facility in Logan, UT.

Summaries of these laboratory methods are also described in *Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Streams and Lakes Protocol: Standard Operating Procedures and Supplementary Materials Version 1.0* (NPS/MOJN/NRR—2012/593.1), available here: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2190896. Specific methods include SOP 13: Laboratory Analysis of BMI and SOP 14: Laboratory Analysis of Water Chemistry.

## Data Processing
Data were evaluated using a collection of QC checks that are part of the MOJN I&M Streams and Lakes R package. These evaluations are summarized in Section 4 of this document. Where unresolvable data quality issues exist, the data have been assigned a flag to indicate the level of concern and further described by a flag note. These flags include Information (not expected to impact the validity of the data), Warning (care should be taken when including the data in analyses), and Critical (serious concerns about the quality of the data, and they should not be used in analyses).

## Code Availability
All of the code used in the preparation of this data package is available in the MOJN I&M Streams and Lakes R Package: https://github.com/nationalparkservice/mojn-stlk-rpackage/releases/tag/1.0.0

# Data Records
The published product is one data package containing multiple CSV data files:

* **`r params$dataPackage1Title`.** Comma-separated text files containing data from the MOJN I&M Streams and Lakes protocol. These data were compiled by the MOJN I&M and were last updated on September 1, 2021. Available at `r paste0("https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/", params$dataPackage1RefID)`.

Ten CSV files contain raw values suitable for use with the MOJN I&M Streams and Lakes R package. Three additional CSV files contain calculated values generated using this R package. These files are clearly labeled as "calculated" (Table 1).

A data dictionary for all of the tables and fields in the published CSV files is provided in XML format with this data package. 

```{r Table1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = capTab("File names and descriptions of published CSVs accompanying this data QC report. There are ten raw files and and additional three calculated files.")}
FileName <- c("Site","Visit","BMI","Channel","Chemistry","Clarity","LakeLevelString","LakeLevelSurvey","WaterQualityDO","WaterQualitypH","WaterQualitySpCond","WaterQualityTemperature","WQStreamXSection","LakeLevel_CALCULATED","WaterQuality_CALCULATED","WQStreamXSection_CALCULATED")
Description <- c("A full description of each of the site codes used in this dataset (Streams and Lakes)","General attributes of the monitoring site visit (Streams and Lakes)","All benthic macroinvertebrate data from all sites (Streams)","Channel characteristics associated with the BMI measurements (Streams)","Laboratory analysis of water chemistry (Streams and Lakes)","Depth and Secchi depth measurements (Lakes)","Lake level measured using a string-based survey","Lake level measured using a digital level-based survey","Dissolved oxygen measured in situ through a depth profile (Lakes)","pH measured in situ through a depth profile (Lakes)","Specific conductance measured in situ through a depth profile (Lakes)","Temperature measured in situ through a depth profile (Lakes)","In situ water quality measured through stream cross sections (Streams)","The calculated lake surface level calculated from the raw data in LakeLevelString and LakeLevelSurvey using the MOJN Streams and Lakes R package (Lakes)","The median water quality values calculated from the four raw WaterQuality data tables (Lakes)","The median water quality values calculated from the raw values in the WQStreamXSection data table (Streams)")
Table <- data.frame(FileName,Description)

reactable(Table,
          columns = list(FileName = colDef(name = "Filename")),
          pagination = FALSE,
          compact = TRUE, striped = TRUE)

```

# Data Quality Evaluation

The data in the data package described above have been reviewed by staff in the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Division to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency with documented data quality standards, as well as for usability and reproducibility. For additional information on data quality standards for this protocol, refer to *Mojave Desert Network Inventory and Monitoring Streams and Lakes Protocol: Standard Operating Procedures and Supplementary Materials Version 1.0* (NPS/MOJN/NRR—2012/593.1), available here: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2190896. Specific methods include SOP 15: Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and SOP 16: Cumulative Measurement Bias.

This data QC report focuses primarily on data collected in WY2022. These data have been summarized and plotted with previously published years of data (WY2019 to WY2021) in order to visualize the data in a broader context and detect outliers. The CSV data files accompanying this report are comprehensive of all years of data from WY2009-2022. The decision to publish a comprehensive dataset was intended to promote data usability by providing all years of data in one set of CSVs with consistent formatting.

## Advice and Caveats
- In 2021 and 2022, no data were collected at Dead Lake because the lake was entirely dry.
- In 2021, the Utah State University National Aquatic Monitoring Center (USU NAMC) revised their benthic macroinvertebrate sample reporting methods. They now refer to abundance metrics as density metrics. In addition, they now use unique taxonomy instead of applying a generic operational taxonomic unit (OTU) scheme. USU NAMC regenerated all previous sample reports, which have been integrated into this data release. As a result, there may be minor discrepancies in metrics values between the earlier WY2009-2020 dataset and this WY2009-2022 dataset.
- In 2021, MOJN I&M standardized the flags applied to water chemistry data that did not meet certain standards or expectations (e.g., below minimum detection level). As a result, there may be occasional discrepancies in flags between the earlier WY2009-2020 dataset and this WY2009-2022 dataset.
- In 2022, NO3-N concentration was reported instead of NO3NO2-N. Because nitrite is usually zero in aerobic samples, the NO3-N concentration should be very close to NO3NO2-N.

## Corrections
In the WY2009-2020 dataset, three lakes had incorrect benchmark and lake surface elevations for WY2012: Brown Lake, Stella Lake, and Teresa Lake. These elevations were corrected in the WY2009-2021 and later datasets.

## Sites not visited {.tabset .tabset-pills}

This is a list of sites that were not visited for annual monitoring during a field season. While Dead Lake was monitored in 2021 and 2022, no data were collected because the lake was entirely dry.

``` {r no.visits, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = capTab("Streams or lakes that were not visited during any given field season.")}

              defaultColDef = reactable::colDef(
                header = function(value) snakecase::to_title_case(value)))
```

## Data processing levels {.tabset .tabset-pills}

This is a list of site visits that have any data labeled as "Raw" or "Provisional." These data need to be reviewed and moved to "Accepted" status before publication of the dataset.

``` {r dpl.check.lake, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = capTab("Lake records with data still labeled as Raw or Provisional.")}
dpl.check <- qcDPLCheck(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource, field.season = year.range)

``` {r dpl.check.stream, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = capTab("Stream records with data still labeled as Raw or Provisional.")}
dpl.check <- qcDPLCheck(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource, field.season = year.range)

`r if(nrow(dpl.check) > 0){"The above records need to be reviewed and accepted before publication."}`

## Lake surface and benchmark elevations {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Benchmark elevations
These are the final calculated benchmark elevations for each lake across recent field seasons. Digital level readings began in 2018.

``` {r benchmark.elevations, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = capTab("Calculated elevations for each lake benchmark and water surface since 2018 when the use of digital level surveys began.")}
benchmark.elevations <- SurveyPointElevation(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource, field.season = year.range)

benchmark.elevations$ClosureError_ft <- round(benchmark.elevations$ClosureError_ft, 4)
benchmark.elevations$FinalCorrectedElevation_ft <- round(benchmark.elevations$FinalCorrectedElevation_ft, 3)

benchmark.elevations %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(Park, SiteShort, DPL, VisitType)) %>%
  reactable::reactable(
              sortable = TRUE,
              filterable = TRUE,
              compact = TRUE,
              striped = TRUE,
              bordered = TRUE,
              highlight = TRUE,
              resizable = TRUE,
              defaultColDef = reactable::colDef(
                header = function(value) snakecase::to_title_case(value)))
```

### Benchmark consistencies

These are the means and standard deviations of final calculated elevations for each benchmark across recent field seasons. Digital level readings began in 2018. The reference mark designated Benchmark 1 was assumed to have an elevation of 100 m (328.084 ft) and used to calculate the final lake level at each lake.

``` {r benchmark.consistency, fig.cap = capTab("Elevation means and standard deviations for each lake benchmark since 2018 when the use of digital level surveys began.")}

Of the `r nrow(lab.dupes)` total lab duplicates, there are `r nrow(lab.dupes %>% filter(RPD > 30))` duplicates with RPD values above the 30% MQO threshold.

### Field duplicates
Field duplicates are additional samples collected from the same location at approximately the same time and using the same methods as the primary sample. These duplicates can help to detect inconsistency in collection methods or variability in water chemistry at a location. This is a list of the relative percent difference (RPD) values for field duplicates and triplicates. Results that exceed the 30% method quality objective (MQO) threshold are flagged.

``` {r field.dupes, fig.cap = capTab("Relative percent difference values for field duplicates and triplicates.")}

### Field blanks
Field blanks are bottles filled with distilled water as opposed to water sampled at the location. They are handled the same way as primary samples in the field and can help to detect and identify sources of contamination during sampling. This is a list of analyte concentrations that exceed the method detection limit (MDL) for that analyte.

``` {r field.blanks, fig.cap = capTab("Analyte concentrations measured in field blanks that exceed the method detection limit.")}

There are `r nrow(field.blanks)` analytes from blanks with concentrations greater than the MDL for that analyte.

### Dissolved nitrogen
These are the records where the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) exceeds total nitrogen (UTN). If the discrepancy falls within precision limits, this indicates that nearly all of the nitrogen is dissolved, and the two concentrations are essentially equal to each other. If the discrepancy falls outside of precision limits, this may indicate contamination of the sample. Alternatively, this may be a consequence of the natural heterogeneity of the water body. The total nutrient concentration is measured from the unfiltered sample, while the dissolved nutrient concentration is measured from the filtered sample. These two samples are collected at approximately the same time and location, but there may be some variability that becomes more evident at low concentrations. Whether the discrepancy falls within or outside precision limits is documented in the notes field.

### Nitrate and nitrite
These are the records where the concentration of nitrate (NO3) and nitrite (NO2) exceeds either total nitrogen (UTN) or total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). If the discrepancy falls within precision limits, this indicates that nearly all of the nitrogen or dissolved nitrogen is in the form of nitrate and nitrite, and the two concentrations are essentially equal to each other. If the discrepancy falls outside of precision limits, this may indicate contamination of the sample. Alternatively, this may be a consequence of the natural heterogeneity of the water body. The total nutrient concentration is measured from the unfiltered sample, while the dissolved nutrient concentration (including nitrate and nitrite) is measured from the filtered sample. These two samples are collected at approximately the same time and location, but there may be some variability that becomes more evident at low concentrations.

### Dissolved phosphorus
These are the records where the concentration of total dissolved phosphorus exceeds total phosphorus. If the discrepancy falls within precision limits, this indicates that nearly all of the phosphorus is dissolved, and the two concentrations are essentially equal to each other. If the discrepancy falls outside of precision limits, this may indicate contamination of the sample. Alternatively, this may be a consequence of the natural heterogeneity of the water body.

### MDL
Minimum detection level (MDL) is defined by the EPA as the "minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the analyte concentration is greater than zero." Below this concentration, presence of the analyte cannot be confirmed. These are the records where the concentration of a certain analyte was less than or equal to the MDL for that analyte.

### ML
Minimum level of quantitation (ML) is defined as the "concentration at which the analytical system gives a recognizable signal and acceptable calibration point for the analyte." Below this concentration, the analyte may be detected (if greater than the MDL) but not measured at a known level of confidence. These are the records where the concentration of a certain analyte was less than or equal to the ML for that analyte.

### Stream nutrients plot
This is a plot of nutrient concentrations for each stream across recent field seasons. Nutrient concentrations include total nitrogen (UTN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate and nitrite as nitrogen (NO3NO2-N), total phosphorus (UTP), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is analyzed occasionally as funding allows.

### Stream ions plot
This is a plot of ion concentrations for each stream across recent field seasons. Ion concentrations include sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfate as sulfur (SO4-S), and chloride (Cl). Alkalinity (ALK2) is also analyzed.

Alkalinity is a property of water defined by the USGS as "the buffering capacity of a water body; a measure of the ability of the water body to neutralize acids and bases and thus maintain a fairly stable pH level." As alkalinity decreases, the sensitivity of a water body to acidification increases. Alkalinity is expressed as mg-CaCO3/L. In 2009, the laboratory measured alkalinity as HCO3. From 2010 to the present, the laboratory measured alkalinity as CaCO3. The alkalinity values from 2009 were recalculated to match the method from 2010 onward. Due to an error in laboratory software programming, ALK2 values analyzed in 2014 and earlier that are less than 20 mg/L may be overestimated (typically 1.5 to 2.5 mg/L, up to 35% difference), with the discrepancy increasing closer to 0 mg/L.

### Discrepancies
These are stream BMI records with discrepancies between taxa group richness (number of taxa within a group) and taxa group density (number of individuals per m2 within a group). Discrepancies include situations where the taxa richness is non-zero but density is zero and where density is non-zero and taxa richness is zero. These situations may arise from the standardization of richness-based metrics to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), while density-based metrics are based on the raw taxa list.

``` {r bmi.discrepancies, fig.cap = capTab("Records where where is a discrepancy between taxa group richness and taxa group density.")}
bmi.discrepancies <- qcBMIDiscrepancies(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource, field.season = year.range)

bmi.discrepancies %<>%
  dplyr::select(-c(Park, SiteShort, VisitType, SampleType, SampleCollectionMethod, BMIMethod, LabNotes)) %>%
  dplyr::relocate(FieldSeason, .after = VisitDate)

  bmi.discrepancies %>%
    reactable(      
      sortable = TRUE,
      filterable = TRUE,
      compact = TRUE,
      striped = TRUE,
      bordered = TRUE,
      highlight = TRUE,
      resizable = TRUE,
      defaultColDef = reactable::colDef(
        header = function(value) snakecase::to_title_case(value)))

```
There are `r nrow(bmi.discrepancies)` metrics with discrepancies between taxa group richness and taxa group density.

### General metrics plot
This plot shows total richness (number of unique taxa within a sample) and total density (number of individuals per m2 within a sample) for stream BMI samples.

``` {r bmi.gen.plot, fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = capFig("Stream benthic macroinvertebrate general metrics."), fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate general metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and richness and density each have a horizontal panel. Counts for the total sample and for dominant family are represented by different line colors."}
bmi.gen.plot <- BMIGeneralMetricsPlot(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource, field.season = year.range)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.gen.plot
} else {
  ggplotly(bmi.gen.plot,
           tooltip = "text") %>%
    layout_ggplotly(x = -0.02, y = -0.03)
}
```

### Diversity metrics plot
This plot shows various diversity metrics and indices for stream BMI samples. Shannon's Diversity is the measure of richness and evenness (based on relative abundance of each species) weighted toward rare species. Simpson's Diversity is the measure of richness and evenness (based on relative abundance of each species) weighted toward common species. Evenness is the measure of relative abundance indicative of taxa dominance. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) is the abundance-weighted average of family-level pollution tolerances.

``` {r bmi.div.plot, fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = capFig("Stream benthic macroinvertebrate diversity metrics."), fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate diversity metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and each of the four diversity metrics has a horizontal panel."}
bmi.div.plot <- BMIDiversityMetricsPlot(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource, field.season = year.range)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.div.plot
} else {
  ggplotly(bmi.div.plot,
           tooltip = "text") %>%
    layout_ggplotly(x = -0.02, y = 0, x_legend = 0, y_legend = 0)
}
```

### Tolerance metrics plot
This plot shows richness (number of taxa within a group) and density (number of individuals per m2 within a group) for stream BMI samples.

Groups are based on tolerance to disturbance or pollution. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) is the abundance-weighted average of family-level pollution tolerances, and is plotted in the diversity metrics section. Tolerant taxa have an HBI score >=8 and are able to withstand disturbance and poor water quality. Intolerant taxa have an BMI score <=2 and are not as able to withstand disturbance and poor water quality. EPT refers to the insect orders Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Tricoptera (caddisflies), which are sensitive to disturbance and whose presence and abundance can indicate good water quality. Long-lived taxa have 2- to 3-year life cycles and can indicate habitat stability and persistent good water quality in their habitat. Clinger taxa have fixed retreats or other strategies for clinging to rocks and are vulnerable to the deposition of fine sediments.

``` {r bmi.tol.plot, fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = capFig("Stream benthic macroinvertebrate tolerance metrics."), fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate tolerance metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and richness and density each have a horizontal panel. Counts for the five tolerance groups are represented by different line colors."}
bmi.tol.plot <- BMIToleranceMetricsPlot(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource, field.season = year.range)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.tol.plot
} else {
  ggplotly(bmi.tol.plot,
           tooltip = "text") %>%
    layout_ggplotly(x = -0.02, y = -0.03)
}
```

### Functional feeding group metrics plot
This plot shows richness (number of taxa within a group) and density (number of individuals per m2 within a group) for stream BMI samples.

Groups are based on functional feeding groups, which refer to the type of food resource that species utilize in the stream. Shredder taxa consume living or decomposing vascular plant tissue and coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM). Scraper taxa consume periphyton, particularly algae and diatoms. Collector-filterer taxa consume fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) in the water column. Collector-gatherer taxa consume FPOM from benthic deposits. Predator taxa consume living animal tissue, usually other BMI, but occasionally small vertebrates. They can indicate that a habitat supports higher trophic complexity.

``` {r bmi.fun.plot, fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = capFig("Stream benthic macroinvertebrate functional feeding group metrics."), fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate functional feeding group metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and richness and density each have a horizontal panel. Counts for the five functional feeding groups are represented by different line colors."}
bmi.fun.plot <- BMIFunctionalMetricsPlot(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource, field.season = year.range)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.fun.plot
} else {
  ggplotly(bmi.fun.plot,
           tooltip = "text") %>%
    layout_ggplotly(x = -0.02, y = -0.03)
}
```

### Taxonomic metrics plot
This plot shows richness (number of taxa within a group) and density (number of individuals per m2 within a group) for stream BMI samples.

Groups are based on taxonomic levels.

- Insecta is a class of six-legged invertebrates within the arthropod phylum.
- Coleoptera is an order of insects that includes beetles.
- Diptera is an order of insects that includes flies and midges.
- Ephemeroptera is an order of insects that includes mayflies.

- Elmidae is a family within Coleoptera that includes riffle beetles.
- Non-Insecta include all individuals not within the class Insecta.
- Mollusca is a phylum that includes gastropods (e.g., snails and slugs), cephalopods (e.g., octopus and squids), and bivalves (e.g., clams).
- Crustacea is another class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that includes crabs, lobsters, crayfish, barnacles, and copepods.
- Oligochaeta is is a subclass of segmented worms within the annelid phylum that includes earthworms and other aquatic worms.

``` {r bmi.tax.plot, fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = capFig("Stream benthic macroinvertebrate taxonomic metrics."), fig.alt = "Line graphs of stream benthic macroinvertebrate taxonomic metrics, with field season on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Each of the nine streams has a vertical panel, and richness and density each have a horizontal panel. Counts for the twelve taxonomic groups are represented by different line colors."}
bmi.tax.plot <- BMITaxonomicMetricsPlot(conn = conn, path.to.data = raw_data_path, data.source = params$dataSource, field.season = year.range)

if (params$isAccessible == "yes") {
  bmi.tax.plot
} else {
  ggplotly(bmi.tax.plot,
           tooltip = "text") %>%
    layout_ggplotly(x = -0.02, y = -0.03)
}
```
